# Lora1276

I couldn't find either a footprint or a symbol for the [Nicerf Lora1276 V2.0](http://www.nicerf.com/product_146_136.html) - module for KiCad, so I decided to make my own ones. I am not very handy with KiCad just yet, so it's entirely possible that these have some issues, but the footprint does actually match the real-world module just fine, so it should be perfectly useable nevertheless.
